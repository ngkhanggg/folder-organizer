# Folder Organizer

It was 3:00 AM and I could not sleep so I decided to organize my "Camera Roll" folder.

Now I am sleep deprived. However, I have a python program that helps me organize my folder upon manual customization.

## What it does

1. Group files by modified year.
2. Rename files following this naming convention: "YYYY_MM_DD HH_MM_SS".
